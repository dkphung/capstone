# Deployment Method

#### I will build a React website to allow input for the 11 features and submit it to a python backend running fastAPI that will use the ML model to perform the prediction. The source code for the client and server are located in the respective folder in the repo. I plan to containerize the application with docker and push the image to Docker Hub. I will deploy the app to AWS cloud service to provide a public accessible URL to the application
